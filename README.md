# Gephi Toolkit sample built with Gradle

* Bundles the [Gephi Toolkit](https://gephi.github.io/toolkit/) jar in `libs/` for you. 
* Comes with some sample code and a sample graph

## Installation
1. Install [gradle](http://gradle.org/)
2. That's it!

## Use
1. `gradle build` will build your code
2. `gradle run` will run it (and build, if you didn't do that already)
3. If you write your own code, put it in `src/main/java` and change the `mainClassName` in `build.gradle` to the class you wrote.
